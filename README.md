## Welcome to the Neon Punk Design System v.0.1.0 by Martin Nørgaard Gregersen

Embark on a journey into the future with our revolutionary design system, crafted for the bold and innovative. In this neon-lit universe, we seamlessly blend futuristic aesthetics with cutting-edge technology, empowering you to create stunning interfaces that defy the ordinary.


## Illuminate with Tokens

Dive into the heart of our system by harnessing the power of tokens. Crafted with precision, our color tokens radiate energy and vibrancy. Typography tokens embody sleek, futuristic fonts that demand attention. Themes, the pulse of our system, bring cohesion to your design language. Developers, brace yourselves as we document the implementation, guiding you through the creation of React components in TypeScript.


## Components and Assets – Building Blocks of Tomorrow

Witness the birth of tomorrow's interfaces with three simple components and a versatile wrapper. Each component, a masterpiece of innovation, carries defined variations that amplify your creative potential. In Storybook, we unveil the design and code, providing a visual and technical journey through the possibilities our components unlock.  
Vector Icons and logo can be found under Assets. Here, you can also explore our palette of Neon Punk Illustrations and patterns, created with Stable Diffusion v1.6, SDXL v1.0.


## Flow – The Neon Pulse of Interaction

Step into the neon-lit dance of interaction by building a flow inspired by our Figma prototype. In Storybook, experience the seamless integration of tokens and components. Watch as the Neon Punk Design System breathes life into your designs, creating a harmonious symphony of visual storytelling.


Unleash your creativity, defy convention, and shape the future – the Neon Punk way. The revolution starts now!
